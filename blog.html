 <h3> George Wythe High School Session </h1>
 <h4>3-5-2019 </h4>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, we were able to help seven students prepare for the upcoming SAT on March 27th. Students were asked which subject they found to be their weakest difficulty and we then proceeded to work with students one on one. We worked through several math problems with students, instilling in them fundamentals that would be of value on the test. For students who found difficulty with reading, we worked with them to find the best strategy to attack the passage. </span></p>
